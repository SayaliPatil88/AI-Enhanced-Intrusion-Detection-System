# 🛡️ AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System

> An AI-powered cybersecurity solution that detects malicious network activity using Machine Learning and provides fast intrusion classification through a Flask-based web interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cyber attacks continue to evolve in complexity, making traditional rule-based security systems insufficient. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze network traffic and identify suspicious activities in real time.

The system is trained on a balanced dataset of web attack records and utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to accurately classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
